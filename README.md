# My Obsidian Vault - Personal Wiki

Welcome to my Git repository dedicated to my Obsidian vault, a space where I reference and organize my knowledge.

## Introduction

This Obsidian vault is intended to serve as a personal reference for my knowledge. Using Obsidian, a Markdown-based note-taking tool, I'm creating an interconnected space to explore, organize and deepen my knowledge in these areas.
